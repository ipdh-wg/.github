# InterPlanetary Data Hub for Open Science/AI(IPDH)

Welcome to the **InterPlanetary Data Hub for Open Science/AI(IPDH)**! This project aims to revolutionize how we manage, share, and version control scientific and AI-related data by leveraging cutting-edge decentralized technologies. By integrating a version control filesystem (JZFS) with Filecoin/IPFS, we provide a scalable, secure, and efficient platform for open science.

## Key Features

- **Version Control with JZFS**: JZFS is a powerful version control filesystem that tracks changes and manages data in a distributed manner, ensuring reproducibility and collaboration.
- **Decentralized Storage with Filecoin/IPFS**: Using Filecoin/IPFS, the platform offers decentralized, secure, and long-term storage solutions for scientific and AI data.
- **Open Science Support**: Built with the principles of open science in mind, our platform supports easy data sharing and collaboration across the globe.
- **AI-Ready**: Designed to handle large datasets, making it ideal for AI and machine learning projects.

## Architecture Overview

The InterPlanetary Data Hub is built on a stack that combines the power of JZFS, IPFS, and Filecoin:

1. **JZFS**: Provides version control capabilities. It tracks changes to files and datasets, enabling users to maintain historical versions and collaborate efficiently.
2. **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A peer-to-peer network that facilitates the storage and sharing of data in a decentralized manner. IPFS allows data to be located and accessed using content-based addressing.
3. **Filecoin**: A decentralized storage network that offers a marketplace for data storage. It provides incentives for storage providers and ensures data persistence over the long term.
